## About Me

I hold a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from McGill University and a DPhil (PhD) in Engineering from the University of Oxford. My doctoral research focused on real-time computer vision, specifically developing algorithms for power-constrained environments, with a thesis centered on depth estimation from stereo cameras.

## Current Interests

My current work continues to be in the exciting field of computer vision. I am particularly interested in the development and application of deep learning techniques to advance vision algorithms.
